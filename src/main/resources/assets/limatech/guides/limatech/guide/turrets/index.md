# A/DU Turrets

The Automated Defensive Unit product line, or **LTX A/DU**, is our area defense machinery series. These turrets
are 2-block tall constructs, the lower block being the base and the top block being the weapon.

## Available Turrets
- [*Atmos*](rocket_turret.md)
- [*Noctis*](railgun_turret.md)

## Machinery Configuration/Upgrades
Like our industrial machines, turrets can use [Machine Upgrade Modules](../fundamentals/upgrade_system.md).
The base of the turret is capable of side-specific Item and Energy IO configuration. Note that the top of the base is not
configurable as it is occupied by the gun.

## Ammunition
Supply them with energy, that's it. The 20 slots on the right hand side are take-only slots used only when a direct drop
collection upgrade module is installed.

## Targeting
Since the turrets are specialized for specific roles, they are selective in what they target. This cannot be changed
at the moment. Refer to each turret's page for more details.
