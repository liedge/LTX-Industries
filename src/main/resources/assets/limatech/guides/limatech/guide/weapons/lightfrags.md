# LightFrag Tech

Light Fragments are solidified shards of volatile light. These beautiful bolts disperse harmlessly against terrain surfaces
but are lethally destructive to organic matter.

Though they might leave different visual traces, LightFrags have **no travel time**.

## Technical Stuff

LightFrag weapons are *hit-scan*. The tracer **and its path** are aesthetic only. The actual weapon ray trace happens from the user's eye
position.
