# General Processing Machines

These machines are the backbone of resource processing. From smelting to crushing and fusing materials, you'll find a machine
for the job. Probably.

## Digital Furnace
<BlockImage id="digital_furnace" scale="2" />
Smelts items. Slightly faster than a regular furnace but can be upgraded.

---

## Digital Smoker
<BlockImage id="digital_smoker" scale="2" />

Specialized smelter for *food items*. Uses **1/3** of the Digital Furnace's energy consumption and processes items
faster. Cheap to make, so if energy is a problem early on consider having one to process food.

---

## Digital Blast Furnace
<BlockImage id="digital_blast_furnace" scale="2" />

Specialized smelter for *ores, metal tools and armor*. Uses **1/2** of the Digital Furnace's energy consumption and
processes items faster. Ore pebbles can be processed by this machine, so consider making one for your ore processing
lines instead of the Digital Furnace.

## Grinder
<BlockImage id="grinder" scale="2" />
Its most important role is to crush ores into ore pebbles for much higher yields. It can also grind cobblestone to gravel,
and gravel to sand.

---

## Recomposer
<BlockImage id="recomposer" scale="2" />
Uses energy to modify a material's molecular composition into something more useful for industrial applications. It's not
strictly required for progression, but it can be a good source of lime dye from a broad source of plant materials.

## Material Fusing Chamber
<BlockImage id="material_fusing_chamber" scale="2" />
Takes up to 3 ingredients and fuses them into a compound material. You'll need this machine to produce Slate Alloy, a
netherite-deepslate compound used in high end recipes. The input slots are not strict can ingredients can be placed in any order.
