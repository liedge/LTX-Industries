# Getting Started
Here are some important tips and tricks that you should know.

## Energy
Common Energy (CE) is LimaTech's name for the default Energy API used by many other mods. You may be familiar with it
as Forge Energy, FE, Redstone Flux, RF, etc.


## Natural Resources

Good news if you don't like mining too much: There are only 2 ores added by LimaTech, Titanium and Niobium. Not so good news,
you need quite a bit of both.

### Titanium
<ItemGrid>
<ItemIcon id="titanium_ore" />
<ItemIcon id="deepslate_titanium_ore"/>
<ItemIcon id="raw_titanium"/>
</ItemGrid>
Titanium is the foundation material for most of the technology in this mod. It generates in the overworld in both Stone
and Deepslate variants, with a higher concentration towards the world floor.

### Niobium
<ItemGrid>

<ItemIcon id="raw_niobium" />
</ItemGrid>
Niobium is a rarer metal used for high-end weaponry, machinery, and electronics. It generates sparsely in the outer End Islands.
Here's a helpful hint: Niobium ore gives off a faint glow. Keep an eye out on the terrain for its distinctive purple color.
