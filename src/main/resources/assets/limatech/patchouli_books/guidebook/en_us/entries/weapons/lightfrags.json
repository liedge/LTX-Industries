    "$(o)LightFrags$(), or Light Fragments, are solidified shards of volatile light. These beautiful yet deadly lime bolts disperse harmlessly on solid surfaces but are catastrophically incompatible with organic matter.",
    "Being fragments of literal light, they move at blinding speeds with the caveat of only being able to travel a short distance before disintegrating. In game design terms, LightFrag based weapons are $(l)hitscan$(). Moving tracer particles are visual effects only, the path trace is instant."
