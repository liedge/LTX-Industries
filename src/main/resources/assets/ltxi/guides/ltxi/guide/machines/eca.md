# Energy Cell Array
<BlockImage id="energy_cell_array" scale="4" />

The **Energy Cell Array** is the primary energy storage block. It features configurable side IO for items and energy.
It has 1 energy input item slot and 4 charging slots.

Smart automation tech prevents items from being removed via pipes/cables/etc. until they are fully charged. They can always
be removed manually by the player though.
