## About

Though it does not have offensive capabilities, *Wayfinder* is a part of our signature-series equipment. It specializes
in range deployment of illumination devices. Launched projectiles have a maximum in-air lifetime of 5 seconds and,
upon impact with a valid surface, will deploy as a persistent block. *Wayfinder* markers can be deployed on any block
face and underwater.
