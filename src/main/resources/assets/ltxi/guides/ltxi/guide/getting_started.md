# Getting Started
Here are some important tips and tricks that you should know.

## Energy
Common Energy (CE) is this mod's way of referring to the default Energy API used by NeoForge. You might know it as
as Forge Energy, FE, Redstone Flux, RF, etc.


## Natural Resources

**This section is accurate for now, but pending re-work as I add more resources.**

### Titanium

<ItemIcon id="raw_titanium"/>
</ItemGrid>
Titanium is the foundation material for most of the technology in this mod. It generates in the overworld in both Stone
and Deepslate variants, with a higher concentration towards the world floor.

### Niobium

Niobium is a rarer metal used for high-end weaponry, machinery, and electronics. It generates sparsely in the outer End Islands.
Here's a helpful hint: Niobium ore gives off a faint glow. Keep an eye out on the terrain for its distinctive purple color.
