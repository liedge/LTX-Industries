## About

**Vitriol Berries** are plants rich in natural acidic compounds. You can find them growing on *Bilevines*, blue-teal
vines that have formed in the abandoned **fortresses and bastions** of the nether. Their favorite spots to grow are under
bridge overhangs and in hallways. To harvest a Bilevine to take home, you'll need to find one with berries, force berries
to grow with bone meal, or break the vine with shears.

## Viridic Acid

This berry is the source of Viridic Acid, the backbone chemical of most of LTX Industries' chemistry processing lines and
a key ingredient for Polymer.
