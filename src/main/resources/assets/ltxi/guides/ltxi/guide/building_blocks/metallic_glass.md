# Metallic Glass

Fusing quartz and metal in the [Material Fusing Chamber](../machines/gpm.md#material-fusing-chamber) produces a crystal-clear
and sturdy glass. These glass blocks are highly resistant to conventional explosions, equivalent to **Obsidian**.
You don't need Silk Touch to break these blocks, but you do need a pickaxe of any tier.
