You can't run a machine without some sort of electronic control. Every device and certain parts use varying tiers of
circuits in their crafting recipe.

The first 3 tiers of circuits, **Basic Circuit**, **Enhanced Circuit**, and **Precision Circuit** can be made in the
Crafting Table, and only use Titanium from LTX Industries' resources. But these recipes are inefficient: only 1 circuit
is made and the circuits use the previous tier circuit. Once you've unlocked the Fabricator and set up a steady source
of Polymer, you gain access to direct and higher yield T1-T3 Circuit Recipes. The Fabricator will also grant you access
to the T4 and T5 Circuits: the **Nano-Core Processor** and the **Real Virtuality Processor**. These are naturally much
more expensive and use 2 of the previous tier circuits.
