# Global Damage Modifiers
Not every weapon is going to perform well in every scenario. Some weapons will struggle against certain types of enemies.
For instance, primary-type weapons will deal reduced damage to medium and high threat enemies.

## Application order
The global damage modifiers apply **after all upgrades**.
