# ε-Series tools

The ε (epsilon) series is our standard tool product line. All tools are unbreakable, run on <Color id="energy">Energy</Color>,
and are [upgradable](../fundamentals/upgrade_system.md).

## Mining Tools

### Modular

<ItemGrid>
<ItemIcon id="ltx_drill" />
<ItemIcon id="ltx_shovel" />
<ItemIcon id="ltx_axe" />
<ItemIcon id="ltx_hoe" />
</ItemGrid>

The Drill, Shovel, Axe and Hoe are designated *modular mining tools*. Switching equipment mode cycles through the 5
available base mining speeds:

- **Off**: Block breaking disabled, including in creative mode.
- **Slow**: 3.0
- **Normal**: 9.0
- **Fast**: 20.0
- **Turbo**: 75.0

The upgrade system can raise the mining level (limit) and expand the set of blocks the tool is effective on. The Shovel,
Axe, and Hoe are effective on their respective materials. The Drill is effective on both *pickaxe* and *shovel*
harvestable materials for mining convenience.

> ε-Series Shovel's default upgrade module grants Silk Touch.

### Non-Modular

<ItemGrid>
<ItemIcon id="ltx_shears" />
<ItemIcon id="ltx_wrench" />
</ItemGrid>

The Wrench and Shears do not have the variable speed or the ability to change effective blocks via the upgrade system.
They still support the enchantment upgrade modules.

> ε-Series Wrench's default upgrade module captures `ltxi:wrench_breakable` block drops directly to your inventory! 

## Melee weapons

<ItemGrid>
<ItemIcon id="ltx_sword" />
<ItemIcon id="ltx_axe" />
</ItemGrid>

The Sword and Axe are designated *melee weapons*. They share certain upgrade modules with the [signature series weapons](../weapons/index.md)
including enchantment modules (Razor and Looting) and target filters.

> The [Equipment Damage Modifier](../fundamentals/damage_modifiers.md) system applies to all ε-Series melee weapons.

## Miscellaneous tools

<ItemGrid>
<ItemIcon id="ltx_fishing_rod" />
<ItemIcon id="ltx_brush" />
<ItemIcon id="ltx_lighter" />
</ItemGrid>

These tools do not currently provide extra capabilities beyond their baseline. It is still recommended to obtain them,
given their cheaper Fabrication cost.
