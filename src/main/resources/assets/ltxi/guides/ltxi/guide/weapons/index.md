# Signature series weaponry

The perfected combination of efficient, sleek beauty and lethality. All of our weapons are
[upgradable equipment](../fundamentals/upgrade_system.md#equipment-upgrade-module).

## Controls

- **Left Click**: Fire weapon.
- **Right Click**: Focus reticle, if applicable.
- **<KeyBind id="key.ltxi.reload_weapon" />** key: Reload weapon.
- **SHIFT+Scroll Wheel up/down**: Switch equipment mode, if applicable.

## LightFrags

**LightFrags** (light fragments) are solidified shards of volatile light. Weapons that use LightFrags as their projectiles
are 'hitscan', meaning that travel and impact happen instantaneously. The optical disruptions along their trajectory
are aesthetic only.
