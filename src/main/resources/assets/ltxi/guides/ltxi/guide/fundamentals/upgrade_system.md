# Modular Upgrade System

Our machinery and LTX gear can be enhanced with upgrade modules! Hold Shift on the module item to see what it does and
on what machines/equipment you can install it on.

## Machine Upgrade Module

For installation on machinery. The upgrade management system is built into upgradable machinery. Look for the Machine
Upgrade Module icon on the right sidebar.

## Equipment Upgrade Module
<ItemImage id="equipment_upgrade_module" />

For installation on equipment items. Unlike machines, you'll need an **Equipment Upgrade Station** to install or manage
upgrades on your equipment.

Insert your equipment item into the equipment slot to manage its upgrades.
