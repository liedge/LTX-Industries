Polymer-metal composites make for great facility building blocks. Once a [polymer production line](../resources/polymer.md)
has been established, Titanium and Slatesteel panels can be produced in large quantities with ease. These have a blast
resistance of **36.0**, strong enough to withstand a point-blank TNT blast as well as most common hostile mob explosions.
