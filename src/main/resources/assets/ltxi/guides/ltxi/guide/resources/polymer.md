# Polymer

**Polymer** is a strong yet very lightweight material. It is easily molded and can form the inner linings and casings
of certain LTX gear and machinery.

Polymer might look complicated to make, but its actually made completely of renewable bio-materials. Crush resinous plants
like Sugar Cane or Bamboo, extract the raw monomer resin with Viridic Acid, and finally react the monomer with Oxygen
to produce the final product. Consult your recipe viewer mod for more specifics on the crafting steps.
