# A/DS Turrets

The Automated Defense System product line, A/DS, specializes in keeping an area free of threats. All turrets are
[upgradeable machines](../fundamentals/upgrade_system.md).

## Available Turrets
- [*Atmos*](rocket_turret.md)
- [*Noctis*](railgun_turret.md)

## Ammunition
Supply them with energy, that's it. The 20 slots on the right hand side are **take-only**, used when a direct drop
collection upgrade module is installed.

## Targeting
Turrets have specialized targeting logic that cannot be changed. Refer to each turret's page for more details.
