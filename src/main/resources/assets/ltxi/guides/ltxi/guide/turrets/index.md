# A/DU Turrets

The Automated Defensive Unit product line, or **LTX A/DU** is our area defense machinery series. The turrets are
*[double block machines](../machines/double_block_machines.md)* and accept [Machine Upgrade Modules](../fundamentals/upgrade_system.md)
like the rest of our industrial machine line.

## Available Turrets
- [*Atmos*](rocket_turret.md)
- [*Noctis*](railgun_turret.md)

## Ammunition
Supply them with energy, that's it. The 20 slots on the right hand side are **take-only*, used when a direct drop
collection upgrade module is installed.

## Targeting
Turrets have specialized targeting logic that cannot be changed. Refer to each turret's page for more details.
