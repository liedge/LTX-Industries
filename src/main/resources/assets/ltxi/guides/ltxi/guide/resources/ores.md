Titanium is the first tier and foundation material for practically everything in LTX Industries. It generates in the
*Overworld* in the *Stone and Deepslate* layers, with a higher concentration towards the world floor. It is only slightly
rarer than iron.

Niobium is a rarer metal used in high-end electronics as a circuit trace material or for the Crystal-Metal exotic
CPU architecture in Tier 4 circuits. It generates sparsely in the outer End Islands. *Niobium ore's purple accents
glow*! Keep an eye out on the terrain for its distinctive purple color.
