A lighting solution that's both performance friendly and aesthetically pleasing. These neon glowing blocks are available
in all dye color variants, and emit a light level of **15**. You can craft these with glowstone blocks in a crafting table,
but a more efficient recipe able to use more glowing ingredients is available via the
[Material Fusing Chamber](../machines/gpm.md#material-fusing-chamber).
