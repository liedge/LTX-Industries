# Ammunition Mechanics

Weapons will need ammo, obviously. Ammo items have a 10% chance to drop from defeated hostile mobs. This drop chance is
affected by **Looting** (+2% chance per level).

### Important reload tip!
Ammo in the magazine is **lost on reload**. To avoid loss of valuable ammo for the stronger weapons, avoid reloading
when not empty if possible.

## Drop Loot Table

When an ammo item drops, it can roll into the following items below. The [Ammo Scavenger](../enchantments/ammo_scavenger.md)
enchantment affects the drop chance distribution, check out that page for more specifics.

| Ammo Type      | Drop Chance |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Automatics** | 79.2%       |
| **Specialist** | 14.9%       |
| **Explosives** | 4.9%        |
| **Heavy**      | 1.0%        |

## Energy Reload Synthesis
Some [upgrade modules](../fundamentals/upgrade_system.md) can allow the weapon to reload using Common Energy rather than an ammo item. It's important
to note, that weapons using CE as a reload source cannot use ammo items anymore.

## Infinite Ammo
Some [upgrade modules](../fundamentals/upgrade_system.md) grant the weapon infinite ammo. The weapon can reload instantly
and does not consume ammo from the magazine.
