# Energy Storage Array
<BlockImage id="energy_storage_array" scale="2" p:up_io="input_only" p:down_io="input_only" p:north_io="output_only"  p:south_io="input_only" p:east_io="input_only" p:west_io="input_only" />

The **Energy Storage Array** is LimaTech's main CE storage block. It features configurable side IO for items and energy.
It has 1 energy input item slot and 4 charging slots.

Smart automation tech prevents items from being removed via pipes/cables/etc. until they are fully charged. They can always
be removed manually by the player though.
